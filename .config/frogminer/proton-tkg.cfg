# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Proton-TkG config file - external config example

##
##   This config file is an example of external config (typical path: ~/.config/frogminer/proton-tkg.cfg)
##   It contains most available options in a centralized way - The few missing options are part of wine-tkg-git and mostly not interesting for proton-tkg
##

# This is a simplified config file with minimal comments. See ../../wine-tkg-git/wine-tkg-profiles/sample-external-config.cfg for more details.
# Some options will be missing from this config file compared to wine-tkg-git as they are enforced.

#### NON-MAKEPKG OPTIONS (Won't affect makepkg builds) ####

# Set to true to get a prompt after the 64-bit part is built, enabling package switching before building the 32-bit side.
# This is a workaround for distros shipping broken devel packages that can't coexist as multilib
_nomakepkg_midbuild_prompt="false"

# Set to true if you want to skip the uninstaller at the end of proton-tkg building
_skip_uninstaller="false"

# Set to true if you do not want your build to be automatically moved to your compatibilitytools.d dir
_no_autoinstall="false"

####

# PROTON-TKG OPTIONS

# Proton branch to target for lsteamclient libs and steam helper on 4.x+ - When using a Wine 3.x base, "proton_3.16" branch will be enforced

# Proton SDL Joystick support, xinput hacks and other gamepad additions. _gamepad_additions depends on _sdl_joy_support.

# Disable nvapi and nvapi64 - Common fix for various games when using a Nvidia GPU
# Might create issues on some native vulkan game calling nvapi for some extremely dumb reason, such as Doom Eternal
_proton_nvapi_disable="true"

# Disable winedbg - (Used to fix GTA V online crash before Proton 5.0-4 02951753)

# Will disable "server-Desktop_Refcount" and "ws2_32-TransmitFile" patchsets on staging past 4e7071e4 (4.7+)
_proton_use_steamhelper="true"

# Set to true to disable proton's steamclient lib substitution. Allows running windows steam client in proton (only affects 4.19+)
# ! This will prevent most Steam games to run directly from proton - You only want to use this as a secondary build for non-steam games or running windows steam/games from windows steam !
_steamclient_noswap="false"

# Enable Winetricks prompt on game launch - Will use your system winetricks, so you need it installed
